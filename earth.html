    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth is <b>the third planet from the sun,</b> and <b>the only astronimical object known to habor life.</b></p>

    <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>

    <h3>Rotation.</h3> 

    <p>Earth's rotation period relative to the sun <b>it's mean solar day</b> is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seonds).
       Because Earth's solor day is now <em>slightly</em> longer than  it was durring the 19th centuary due to tidal declaration,
       <b>each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its steller day by the international Earth Rotationand Reference
        Systems Services (IRES), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time ( UT1 ), or 23h 56m 4.0989s. Earth's rotation period relative
        to the proccessing or moving mean vernalequinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time ( UT1 ) 
        ( 23h 56m 4.0905s ). Thus the sidereal day day is shorter than the steller day by about 8.4 ms. [ 187 ] The length of the mean solar
        day in SI seconds is available from the IRES for the periods 1623-2005[188] and 1962-2005.

        Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main appartent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's
        sky is to the west at a rate of 15&deg;/h = 15&deg; /min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an appartent
        diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two mintues; from Earth's surface, the aparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately
        the same
    </p>

    <h3>Orbit.</h3>

    <p>
        Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one 
        sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day,
        which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours-a solar day-for 
        Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth
        averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter,
        about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.

    </p>

    <p>
        The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the 
        Earth-Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days.
        Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise.
        Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction 
        about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the
        perpendicular to the Earth-Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the 
        Earth-Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and
        solar eclipses.
